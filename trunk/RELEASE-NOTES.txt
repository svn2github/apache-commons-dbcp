This release includes new features as well as bug fixes and enhancements.
Version 2.0.x supports JDBC 4.1, so requires JDK 1.7. Applications running under
JDK 1.4-1.5 must use DBCP 1.3.x. Applications running under JDK 1.6 should use
DBCP 1.4.x. Applications running under JDK 1.7 may use also use DBCP 1.5.x.

Changes since DBCP 1.3/1.4/1.5 include:

New features:
o  Provide a new option (cacheState) to cache current values of autoCommit and
   readOnly so database queries are not required for every call to the
   associated getters. This option is enabled by default.

Fixed Bugs:
o  DBCP-300: Removed unnecessary synchronisation in
             BasicDataSource#createDataSource

Changes:
o  The package has been changed from org.apache.commons.dbcp to
   org.apache.commons.dbcp2.
o  Update to Commons Pool 2 (based on java.util.concurrent) to provide
   pooling functionality.
o  Updated source code for Java 1.7 (added @Override annotations).
o  Removed JOCL support.

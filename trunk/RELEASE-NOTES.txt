This release includes new features as well as bug fixes and enhancements.
Version 2.0.x supports JDBC 4, so requires JDK 1.6.  Applications running under
JDK 1.4-1.5 must use DBCP 1.3.x. Applications running under JDK 1.6 should use
DBCP 2.0.x.

Changes since DBCP 1.3/1.4 include:

New features:
o  Cache current values of autoCommit and readOnly so database queries are not
   required for every call to the associated getters.

Fixed Bugs:
o  DBCP-300: Removed unnecessary synchronisation in
             BasicDataSource#createDataSource

Changes:
o  The package has been changed from org.apache.commons.dbcp to
   org.apache.commons.dbcp2.
o  Update to Commons Pool 2 (based on java.util.concurrent) to provide
   pooling functionality.
o  Updated source code for Java 1.6 (added @Override annotations).
o  Removed JOCL support.

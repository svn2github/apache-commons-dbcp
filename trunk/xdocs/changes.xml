This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
CVS commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.

    <release version="1.3" date="TBD" description="This release will include
     new features as well as bug fixes and instrumentation.  Some bug fixes
     will change semantics (e.g. connection close will become idempotent).
     The minimum JDK level will be increased to 1.4">
      <action dev="bayard" type="fix" issue="DBCP-218">
        Corrected Javadoc to state that getLoginTimeout and setLoginTimeout are
        NOT supported by BasicDataSource.
      </action>
      <action dev="bayard" type="add" issue="DBCP-211">
        Added Maven 2 pom.xml. Removed a block of code from TestJOCLed that set
        the Xerces parser manually. This was to support early JDKs. The 1.3
        version of DBCP requires JDK 1.4+.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="add" issue="DBCP-228" due-to="Dain Sundstrom">
        Added support for pooling managed connections.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="add" issue="DBCP-230" due-to="Dain Sundstrom">
        Added BasicManagedDataSource, extending BasicDataSource.
        Also improved extensibility of BasicDataSource by encapsulating
        methods to create object pool, connection factory and datasource
        instance previously embedded in createDataSource.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="DBCP-233" due-to="Dain Sundstrom">
        Changed behavior to allow Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement,
        CallableStatement and ResultSet to be closed multiple times. The first
        time close is called the resource is closed and any subsequent calls
        have no effect. This behavior is required as per the JavaDocs for these
        classes. Also added tests for closing all types multiple times and
        updated any tests that incorrectly assert that a resource can not be
        closed more then once.  Fixes DBCP-3, DBCP-5, DBCP-23 and DBCP-134.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="DBCP-11" due-to="Dain Sundstrom">
        Modified PoolingDataSource, PoolingDriver and DelegatingStatement to
        assure that all all returned Statements, PreparedStatements, 
        CallableStatements and ResultSets are wrapped with a delegating object,
        which already properly handle the back pointers for Connection and
        Statement.  Also added tests to to assure that the *same* object used 
        to create the statement or result set is returned  from either 
        getConnection() or getStatement().
      </action>
      <action dev="dain" type="update" issue="DBCP-143">
        SQLNestedException has been deprecated and will be replaced in DBCP 1.4 with
        SQLException and standard Java exception chaining.
      </action>
      <action dev="dain" type="fix" issue="DBCP-221">
        BasicDataSource.close() now permanently marks the data source as closed,
        and no new connections can be obtained from the data source. At close all
        idle connections are destroyed and the method returns.  As the remaining
        active connections are closed, they are destroyed.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="DBCP-241">
        Eliminated potential sources of NullPointerExceptions in 
        PoolingConnection.
      </action>

         Database Connection Pool API.
      </p>

      <b>Overview in Dialog Form</b>
      <p>
         Q: How do I use the DBCP package?
      </p><p>
         A: There are two primary ways to access the DBCP pool, as a
         {@link java.sql.Driver Driver}, or as a {@link javax.sql.DataSource DataSource}.
         You'll want to create an instance of {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDriver} or
         {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource}.  When using one of these
         interfaces, you can just use your JDBC objects the way you normally would.
         Closing a {@link java.sql.Connection} will simply return it to its pool.
      </p>
      <p>
         Q: But {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDriver PoolingDriver} and
         {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource PoolingDataSource} both expect an
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool ObjectPool} as an input.  Where do I
         get one of those?
      </p><p>
         A: The {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool ObjectPool} interface is defined
         in the {@link org.apache.commons.pool} package (Commons-Pool).
         The {@link org.apache.commons.pool.impl} package has a couple of implementations,
         and you can always create your own.
      </p>
      <p>
         Q: Ok, I've found an {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool ObjectPool}
         implementation that I think suits my connection pooling needs.  But it wants
         a {@link org.apache.commons.pool.PoolableObjectFactory PoolableObjectFactory}.
         What should I use for that?
      </p><p>
         A: The DBCP package provides a class for this purpose. It's called
         {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolableConnectionFactory}.
         It implements the factory and lifecycle methods of
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.PoolableObjectFactory}
         for {@link java.sql.Connection}s.  But it doesn't create the actual database
         {@link java.sql.Connection}s itself, it uses a
         {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.ConnectionFactory} for that.
         The {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolableConnectionFactory} will take
         {@link java.sql.Connection}s created by the {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.ConnectionFactory}
         and wrap them with classes that implement the pooling behaviour.
      </p><p>
         Several implementations of {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.ConnectionFactory} are
         provided--one that uses {@link java.sql.DriverManager} to create connections
         ({@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.DriverManagerConnectionFactory}),
         one that uses a {@link java.sql.Driver} to create connections
         ({@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.DriverConnectionFactory}),
         one that uses a {@link javax.sql.DataSource} to create connections
         ({@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.DataSourceConnectionFactory}).
      </p>
      <p>
         Q: I think I'm starting to get it, but can you walk me though it again?
      </p><p>
         A: Sure.  Let's assume you want to create a {@link javax.sql.DataSource}
         that pools {@link java.sql.Connection}s.  Let's also assume that
         those pooled {@link java.sql.Connection}s should be obtained from
         the {@link java.sql.DriverManager}.
         You'll want to create a {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource}.
      </p><p>
         The {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource} uses an underlying
         {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool} to create and store its
         {@link java.sql.Connection}.
      </p><p>
         To create a {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool}, you'll need
         a {@link org.apache.commons.pool.PoolableObjectFactory} that creates
         the actual {@link java.sql.Connection}s.  That's what
         {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolableConnectionFactory} is for.
      </p><p>
         To create the {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolableConnectionFactory},
         you'll need at least two things:
         <ol>
          <li>
            A {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.ConnectionFactory} from which
            the actual database {@link java.sql.Connection}s will be obtained.
          </li>
          <li>
            An empty and factory-less {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool}
            in which the {@link java.sql.Connection}s will be stored.
            <br></br>
            When you pass an {@link org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool} into the
            {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolableConnectionFactory}, it will
            automatically register itself as the {@link org.apache.commons.pool.PoolableObjectFactory}
            for that pool.
          </li>
         </ol>
         You can optionally provide a {@link org.apache.commons.pool.KeyedObjectPoolFactory}
         that will be used to create {@link org.apache.commons.pool.KeyedObjectPool}s for
         pooling {@link java.sql.PreparedStatement}s for each {@link java.sql.Connection}.
      </p><p>
         In code, that might look like this:
<pre>GenericObjectPool connectionPool = new GenericObjectPool(null);
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new DriverManagerConnectionFactory("jdbc:some:connect:string", "username", "password");
PoolableConnectionFactory poolableConnectionFactory = new PoolableConnectionFactory(connectionFactory,connectionPool,null,null,false,true);
PoolingDataSource dataSource = new PoolingDataSource(connectionPool);</pre>
      </p><p>
         To create a {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDriver}, we do the same thing,
         except that instead of creating a {@link javax.sql.DataSource} on the last line,
         we create a {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDriver}, and register the
         <tt>connectionPool</tt> with it.  E.g.,:
<pre>GenericObjectPool connectionPool = new GenericObjectPool(null);
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new DriverManagerConnectionFactory("jdbc:some:connect:string", "username", "password");
PoolableConnectionFactory poolableConnectionFactory = new PoolableConnectionFactory(connectionFactory,connectionPool,null,null,false,true);
PoolingDriver driver = new PoolingDriver();
driver.registerPool("example",connectionPool);</pre>
      </p><p>
         Since the {@link org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDriver} registers itself
         with the {@link java.sql.DriverManager} when it is created, now you can just
         go to the {@link java.sql.DriverManager} to create your {@link java.sql.Connection}s,
         like you normally would:
<pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:apache:commons:dbcp:example");</pre>
      </p>

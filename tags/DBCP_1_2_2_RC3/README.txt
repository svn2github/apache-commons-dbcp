Apache Jakarta Commons DBCP
===========================

Welcome to the DBCP component of the Apache Jakarta Commons
project (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons). 

DBCP uses Maven 1 (http://maven.apache.org) for build 
process management. It is known to build with Maven 1.0.2,
though other versions may also work. 

To build DBCP using Maven, type "maven" at a command line prompt
from the top-level directory of the source distribution (the directory
that contains the file named project.xml).

DBCP can also be built using Ant from the build.xml file. 
Locations of dependent jars for the Ant build need to be specified in 
build.properties.  There is a build.properties.sample file included in the
source distribution.

The binary distribution was built using JDK 1.4.2_10. The Ant build includes
conditional compilation to support building on JDK 1.3. 

This release of JDBC compiles with and supports JDK 1.3 (JDBC 2.0) and
JDK 1.4-1.5 (JDBC 3.0). JDK 1.6 (JDBC 4.0) is not supported by this release. 

See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/ for additional and 
up-to-date information on Commons DBCP.

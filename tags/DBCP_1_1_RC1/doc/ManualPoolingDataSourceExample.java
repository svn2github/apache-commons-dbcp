// Here are the dbcp-specific classes.
// Note that they are only used in the setupDriver
// method. In normal use, your classes interact
// only with the standard JDBC API
//
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import org.apache.commons.pool.ObjectPool;
import org.apache.commons.pool.impl.GenericObjectPool;
import org.apache.commons.dbcp.ConnectionFactory;
import org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource;

//
// Here's a simple example of how to use the PoolingDataSource.
// In this example, we'll construct the PoolingDataSource manually,
// just to show how the pieces fit together, but you could also
// configure it using an external conifguration file in
// JOCL format (and eventually Digester).
//

//
// Note that this example is very similiar to the PoolingDriver
// example.  In fact, you could use the same pool in both a
// PoolingDriver and a PoolingDataSource
//

//
// To compile this example, you'll want:
//  * commons-pool.jar
//  * commons-dbcp.jar
//  * j2ee.jar (for the javax.sql classes)
// in your classpath.
//
// To run this example, you'll want:
//  * commons-collections.jar
//  * commons-pool.jar
//  * commons-dbcp.jar
//  * j2ee.jar (for the javax.sql classes)
//  * the classes for your (underlying) JDBC driver
// in your classpath.
//
// Invoke the class using two arguments:
//  * the connect string for your underlying JDBC driver
//  * the query you'd like to execute
// You'll also want to ensure your underlying JDBC driver
// is registered.  You can use the "jdbc.drivers"
// property to do this.
//
// For example:
//  java -Djdbc.drivers=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver \
//       -classpath commons-collections.jar:commons-pool.jar:commons-dbcp.jar:j2ee.jar:oracle-jdbc.jar:. \
//       ManualPoolingDataSourceExample
//       "jdbc:oracle:thin:scott/tiger@myhost:1521:mysid"
//       "SELECT * FROM DUAL"
//
public class ManualPoolingDataSourceExample {

        //
        // First we load the underlying JDBC driver.
        // You need this if you don't use the jdbc.drivers
        // system property.
        //

        Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
        System.out.println("Done.");

        //
        // Then, we set up the PoolingDataSource.
        // Normally this would be handled auto-magically by
        // an external configuration, but in this example we'll
        // do it manually.

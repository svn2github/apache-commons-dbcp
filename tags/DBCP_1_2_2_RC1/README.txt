Apache Jakarta Commons DBCP
===========================

Welcome to the DBCP component of the Apache Jakarta Commons
project (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons). 

DBCP uses Maven 1 (http://maven.apache.org) for build 
process management. It is known to build with Maven 1.0.2,
though other versions may also work. 

To build DBCP using Maven, type "maven" at a command line prompt
from the top-level directory of the source distribution (the directory
that contains the file named project.xml).

DBCP can also be build using ant from the build.xml file. 
This file is generated by Maven and all required jars will be 
downloaded. 

See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/ for additional and 
up-to-date information on Commons DBCP.
